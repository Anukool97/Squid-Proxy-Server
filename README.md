  AS you can see i am creating custom error page only for google.com
  
   2. acl abcd dstdomain .google.com

     <title> CUSTOM ERROR</title>
     <body>
     
     <h1>This is just a custom error page example to show you. YOU can link it with custom css and custom javascript file </h1>

#save and quit 
#now you have to restart proxy server

7. service squid restart


#NOTE ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
#check it again by going to www.google.com since i have only created custom error for that page only
#you can just add lines manually like "acl abcd dstdomain .anysite.com" in the config file or
#you can create a path as created befor "/etc/squid/blocked_sites.acl" and assign a variable "abcd" to it.


# IMPORTANT TO NOTE

1> Firefox setting of the client machine has to be changed to manual proxy setting and the ip address will be set to ip address of server machine only .
here proxy :172.16.50.72 will be set with port 3128
