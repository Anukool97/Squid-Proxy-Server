#save and quit 
#now you have to restart proxy server

7. service squid restart


#NOTE ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
#check it again by going to www.google.com since i have only created custom error for that page only
#you can just add lines manually like "acl abcd dstdomain .anysite.com" in the config file or
#you can create a path as created befor "/etc/squid/blocked_sites.acl" and assign a variable "abcd" to it.


# IMPORTANT TO NOTE

1> Firefox setting of the client machine has to be changed to manual proxy setting and the ip address will be set to ip address of server machine only .
here proxy :(SERVER IP) will be set with port 3128

# ********************************************************************************************************************************************HOW TO STOP PEOPLE ACCESS THE INTERNET FROM TERMINAL AND ALLOW ONLY AFTER GIVING USERNAME AND PASSWORD FOR THAT PROXY SERVER FROM TERMINAL*****************************************************************************************************************************************

> Go to /etc/apt directory
1. cd /etc/apt

2. vim apt.conf 
( apt.conf should only be the name of the file please donot make with anyother name )

Now write the following inside the file

# NOTE just copy paste below lines , donot write your username and password here , it is just general instruction given to machine to check it.

3. Acquire::http::proxy "http://username:password@proxyserver:port/";

4. Acquire::https::proxy "https://username:password@proxyserver:port/";

5. Acquire::socks::proxy "socks://username:password@proxyserver:port/";

save and Quit it.

# Always remember to restart the service , ie "service squid restart"

# go to client machine or you can check for server machine also

After restarting the service, go to terminal with root user ("#" symbol)  and type ...

5a. curl www.google.com
# it will not let you run any command now from terminal

6. export http_proxy="http://usercreated_by_you:psswordcreated_by_you@serverIPaddress:3128"
# here username , password and ip will be put by your side to get the authentication from server .

6a. curl www.google.com 

Type any command and it will work since you have the access to proxy server.
