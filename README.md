#NOTE ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
#check it again by going to www.google.com since i have only created custom error for that page only
#you can just add lines manually like "acl abcd dstdomain .anysite.com" in the config file or
#you can create a path as created befor "/etc/squid/blocked_sites.acl" and assign a variable "abcd" to it.
